= SPEC-01: Data Visualization Library
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The data visualization library is an open-source initiative designed to support web and mobile applications with SVG and Canvas-based charting capabilities. It is not aimed at any specific industry but is intended to be versatile enough for use in various application contexts. The primary users of this library are software developers who seek to integrate advanced data visualization into their applications.

== Requirements

The requirements for the data visualization library are prioritized following the MoSCoW method:

.Must-Have
* Support for rendering using SVG and Canvas.
* Accept JSON configuration for defining charts.
* Chart types: Line, Area, Bar, Column, Spline, AreaSpline, Scatter, Heatmap, Pie, Donut, Bubble, Waterfall.
* Accessibility compliant.
* Features for interactivity: title, subtitle, interactive legend, tooltip, zoom, pan, hover, and zoom select.

.Should-Have
* Drill-down capabilities.
* 3D chart support.

== Method

=== Architecture Overview
* Core Library: Handles basic chart rendering logic, input processing, and output generation, agnostic of the rendering method.
* Rendering Engines: Separate engines for SVG and Canvas to execute specific commands for each rendering type.
* Plugin System: Allows for extensibility by enabling developers to add new chart types or features without altering the core codebase.

=== Algorithms and Logic
* JSON Config Parser: Converts JSON configuration into internal chart specifications.
* Rendering Logic: Initializes, draws, and manages user interactions based on the provided configurations.

=== Performance Considerations
* Efficient data structures and caching.
* Lazy loading and incremental rendering for better performance.

== Implementation

1. Set Up Development Environment: TypeScript setup, testing frameworks, CI/CD pipelines.
2. Develop Core Library: Functionality for processing JSON and managing chart state.
3. Create Rendering Engines: SVG and Canvas renderers.
4. Implement Interactive Features: Accessibility, tooltips, zoom, pan, and other interactive elements.
5. Plugin System Development: Architecture for extending the library.
6. Optimization and Testing: Performance tuning and extensive testing.
7. Documentation and Release: Complete documentation and prepare for release.

== Milestones

1. Milestone 1: Project Setup and Core Development - Month 1-2
2. Milestone 2: Rendering Engines and Basic Charts - Month 3-4
3. Milestone 3: Advanced Chart Types and Interactivity - Month 5-6
4. Milestone 4: Plugin Architecture and Optimization - Month 7-8
5. Milestone 5: Documentation and Launch - Month 9

== Gathering Results

* Functional Testing: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
* Performance Evaluation: Measure rendering speeds and responsiveness.
* Accessibility Compliance Testing: Ensure WCAG compliance.
* User Feedback: Surveys, forums, and user testing for feedback and improvement.
* Maintenance and Updates: Regular updates based on user feedback and new standards.

=== Evaluation Metrics
* Functionality: Test cases passed.
* Performance: Rendering and interaction times.
* Accessibility: Compliance level with WCAG.
* User Satisfaction: Ratings from surveys and studies.
